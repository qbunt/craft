While still in college, I designed, developed and patented a line of cookware for nationwide cookware manufacturer Calphalon.  The series of cookware features a non-stick surface, rubber overmolded stay-cool handles and a modern understated aesthetic.

While working at The Calphalon Group, I developed this line using state of the art CAD and 3D printing technologies, as well as traditional product design skills.  This background allows me to approach interactive design and development from a fresh, rare perspective.

This line was <a href="http://bit.ly/bkZTA2" target="_blank">patented</a> and was available exclusively at Kohl's Department Stores.
